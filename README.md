AMP: **A**ssessing phylogenetic **M**odel fit with **P**osterior prediction

AMP is software for assessing phylogenetic model fit through the use of posterior predictive simulation and inference-based test statistics (or quantities). It is written in python and runs from the command line.

No user's manual has been written yet. For basic information on command-line syntax, download the code and run it by typing: "python amp0.98.py --help".

When using AMP, please cite: [Brown, J. M. 2014. Detection of Implausible Phylogenetic Inferences Using Posterior Predictive Assessment of Model Fit. _Systematic Biology_. 63:334-348.](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/63/3/334/1649587/Detection-of-Implausible-Phylogenetic-Inferences)

## Dependencies

AMP takes advantage of the wonderful [Dendropy library (version 3)](http://packages.python.org/DendroPy/), written by Jeet Sukumaran and Mark Holder. Please also cite Dendropy when using AMP!
